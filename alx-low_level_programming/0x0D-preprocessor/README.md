n C programming language, the preprocessor is a program that processes the source code before the actual compilation. The preprocessor is responsible for handling the preprocessor directives, which are special instructions that are processed before the code is compiled.

#include: Used to include header files in the code. #define: Used to define macros or constants. #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #endif: Used to conditionally compile code based on whether a particular macro is defined or not. #pragma: Used to provide additional information to the compiler. The preprocessor can be useful in several ways, such as:
